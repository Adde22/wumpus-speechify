- Give the possibility to skip the intro when playing a second time.

- Make it possible to hear the instructions again "Did you understand the instructions
or do you want to hear them one more time?"

- Implement some kind of "help"-section that can be called during the game
	Maybe just explain what can be done in the current situation ("you can move,
	you should use arrows to shoot Wumpus, be careful when you can smell
	Wumpus' breath, etc.")

- Give the general possibility to repeat instructions and explain it in the start.

- Look into possibility to slow down synthesis (e.g. lower rate to 130 wpm)

- Speech Recognition should be keyword-based

- Advanced: the system should react to uncertainty/pauses/fillers
