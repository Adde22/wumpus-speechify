Which characteristics of the system did you like best?
- Understanding me. (1)
- That you have to use your imagination to actually play the game. (1)
- The description of the environment, it was fun / comic. (2)
- I was impressed by how fluent it seemed. (3)
- Possibility to adapt after each move, feeling "in control" of the story. (4)
- The system understood me. (5)

Which characteristics of the system disturbed you mostly? 
- As a not-native English speaker I thought the speed was slightly fast and in combination with the pronunciation it was a bit hard to follow sometimes (1)
- It was short, I wanted to play more (2)
- That the same phrase always had the same intonation. (3)
- Repeated commands -> the system wouldn't adapt if I voice my choice before the instructions were over. (4)
- I didn't understand what to do. Partly because of the vocabulary but also because I didn't remember anymore while the game was on. (5)
- un-human voice. (6)

Do you have any proposals for system improvement?
- Possibly to hear the instructions again. (1)
- I though I understood the game, but since I died so fast I probably didn't. I want to know why. (1)
- It might be good if the system could recognize mumbling and not try to extract text from it. (3)
- See above: Make the system adapt based on voice commands spoken during the instructions -> makes it more speedy and less emitter / transmitter only. (4)- Ask for repeating last message. (6)
